# &lt;FILL IN&gt; CA root certificate Installer

This addon adds the &lt;FILL IN&gt; root certificate to the Firefox trusted root store.

You can also use [certutil](https://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/tools/certutil.html#1034010) to add root certificates to Firefox.

## Todo

Would be nice to also add the Revocation List when available. I was not able to find out how to do this.
